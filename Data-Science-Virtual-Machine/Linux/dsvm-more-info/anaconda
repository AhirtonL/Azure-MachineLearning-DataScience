Anaconda is a popular Python distribution containing several pre-built and tested scientific and analytic Python packages that include NumPy, Pandas, SciPy, Matplotlib, and IPython. It also provides a package management to easily download many more Python libraries just by entering "conda install <package name>".

This installation contains both Python 2.7 and Python 3.5. Python 3.5 is the the instance in the default PATH. You can change this in the profile file (/etc/profile.d/dsvm.sh). 

To activate Python 2.7 run the following from the shell:

source /anaconda/bin/activate root

Python 2.7 is installed at /anaconda/bin. 

You can look at packages installed by running:
pip list

To activate Python 3.5 run the following from the shell:

source /anaconda/bin/activate py35

Python 3.5 is installed at /anaconda/envs/py35/bin

You can look at packages installed in Python 3.5 by running:
pip list


To install any package try in the following order:

conda install <package name>

pip install <package name>

You will be installing the package in the currently activated environment. 

To run python interactively just type "python" in shell to run the currently activated version. If you are on a graphical (X2go) client, you can also use the Spyder IDE by typing "spyder". In addition you can use text editors like VIM, Emacs or gedit.
