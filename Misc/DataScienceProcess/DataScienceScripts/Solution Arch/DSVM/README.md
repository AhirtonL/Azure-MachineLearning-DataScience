[![Deploy to Azure](http://azuredeploy.net/deploybutton.png)](https://azuredeploy.net/)

The Data Science Virtual Machine is an Azure virtual machine (VM) image pre-installed and configured with several popular tools that are commonly used for data analytics and machine learning. The tools included are:

- Revolution R Open
- Anaconda Python distribution
- Visual Studio Community Edition
- Power BI desktop
- SQL Server Express edition
- Azure SDK


Doing Data Science involves iterating on a sequence of tasks: finding, loading, and pre-processing data, building and testing models, and deploying the models for consumption in intelligent applications. It is not uncommon for data scientists to use a variety of tools to to complete these tasks. It can be quite time consuming to find the appropriate versions of the software, and then download and install them. The Data Science VM can ease this burden. 

The Data Science VM jump starts your analytics project. It enables you to work on tasks in a variety of languages including R, Python, SQL, and C#. Visual Studio provides an IDE to develop and test your code that is easy to use. The Azure SDK included in the VM allows you to build your applications using various services on Microsoftâ€™s cloud platform.
