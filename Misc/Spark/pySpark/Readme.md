This folder contains pySpark notebooks for published data science walk-throughs published here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/machine-learning-data-science-spark-overview

We now have notebooks in both Spark 1.6, and Spark 2.0, that can be run on Azure Spark HDInsight clusters.


Spark 1.6 NBs are:

1. pySpark-machine-learning-data-science-spark-data-exploration-modeling.ipynb [Provides information on how to perform data explorationand modeling with a few different algorithms]
2. pySpark-machine-learning-data-science-spark-advanced-data-exploration-modeling.ipynb [Insludes topics in notebook #1, and model development using hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation]
3. pySpark-machine-learning-data-science-spark-model-consumption.ipynb [Shows how to operationalize a saved model using python on HDInsight clusters]

A detailed explanation of the 1.6 NBs are available on the above link.


Spark 2.0 NBs are:

1. pySpark3-Spark2.0-machine-learning-data-science-spark-advanced-data-exploration-modeling.ipynb [This file provides information on how to perform data exploration and modeling in Spark 2.0 clusters. Should be run on the pySpark3 kernel of Jupyter server provided on HDInsight clusters]
