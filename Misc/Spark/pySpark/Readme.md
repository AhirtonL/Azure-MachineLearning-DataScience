This folder contains pySpark notebooks for published data science walk-throughs published here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/machine-learning-data-science-spark-overview

We now have notebooks in both Spark 1.6, and Spark 2.0, that can be run on the Jupyter notebook servers of Azure Spark HDInsight clusters.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<b>Spark 1.6 NBs (to be run in the pyspark kernel of Jupyter notebook server):</b>


> pySpark-machine-learning-data-science-spark-data-exploration-modeling.ipynb

Provides information on how to perform data explorationand modeling with a few different algorithms
<br>


> pySpark-machine-learning-data-science-spark-advanced-data-exploration-modeling.ipynb

Includes topics in notebook #1, and model development using hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation
<br>

> pySpark-machine-learning-data-science-spark-model-consumption.ipynb

Shows how to operationalize a saved model using python on HDInsight clusters
<br>

A detailed explanation of the 1.6 NBs are available on the above link.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Spark 2.0 NBs (to be run in the pySpark3 kernel of Jupyter notebook server):

1. pySpark3-Spark2.0-machine-learning-data-science-spark-advanced-data-exploration-modeling.ipynb

This file provides information on how to perform data exploration and modeling in Spark 2.0 clusters. Should be run on the pySpark3 kernel of Jupyter server provided on HDInsight clusters
