This folder contains Scala codes and notebooks that show how to perform data science on Spark on Azure HDInsight clusters using Scala. 

We previously published similar end-to-end data science process walkthrough on Spark using pySpark. Files here show similar content in Scala. 

It shows how to use Scala for:
1. Data ingestion.
2. Data exploration and visualization using python's matplotlib and Jupyter's internal auto-visualization features.
3. Feature transformation and engineering.
4. Creation of ML models using both MLlib and Spark ML libraries.
5. Saving the models in Azure blob.
6. Loading saved models and scoring data-sets with these models.

We do not show automated / scheduled model consumption. Users can easily get that from the pySpark walkthrough and associated notebooks.
